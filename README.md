Webscraping Demos

Requests - Is old style will mostly work on solely HTML frameworks https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html

Webdriver - uses a webdriver and mostly focuses on selenium library https://pypi.org/project/selenium/

The chromedriver link is here https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=89.0.4389.23/, you will need a different one if you don't use windows.

Firefox does one as well I believe

Built to run on 3.7
